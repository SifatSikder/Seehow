0 4 what's up guys welcome to your 12th Android tutorial what we're gonna do in
4 13 this tutorial set up our own activity from scratch home made Java is what
13 16 we're going to be doing we're going to set up a java class so we're gonna go up
16 21 to our source folder and right-click and go to new either
21 26 I'm sorry new class right here hit OK and we're going to call this
26 32 splash with the capital S and again I should guys should just tell you this
32 36 because since we're working with Java it's basically good grammar for your
36 40 class names to start with the uppercase letter I didn't do that with the
40 44 starting point that other other class that we have called starting point but
44 50 general rule of thumb you want to have it uppercase not a huge deal but you
50 54 know whatever and then we're going to hit finish got our class started and now
54 58 as we we're just also going to open our starting point class as a reference you
58 64 guys can kind of see what we need to set up here now right now it's just a Java
64 69 class it's not an activity and Android uses activities they're basically like
69 75 different tabs for example this is a tab and this is a tab think of this is an
75 80 activity for the most part and then we can open up this activity and it will
80 83 put that previous activity behind it and then if we hit the back button on our
83 87 phone it opens this activity I don't know if that made sense but they're
87 90 basically like different windows or different tabs that's what an activity
90 94 is so we want our splash to be an activity so what we're going to say is
94 102 extends activity and what extends means is that we're extending the activity
102 106 class so we have to import this activity class which comes from the Android app
106 111 package again from the SDK for the most part so we're going to import that and
111 117 what extends means is we're since we're using or extending this activity class
117 122 we can use some of the methods from within that activity class now let's go
122 125 back to the starting point and we notice that we have this method called oncreate
125 128 so we're going to add that real quickly so we're going to add that real quickly
128 134 by right-clicking within the brackets going down to the source and then going
134 141 to override implement methods click that as you can see here's our activity class
141 145 that we're extending and we can use all these methods from within that activity
145 150 class there's a method called oncreate which you guys saw in our starting point
150 154 activity so we're going to click this and make sure it's the one that takes in
154 160 but takes a bundle within its parameters click OK and we have our activity for
160 166 the most part set up at least our oncreate method set up and now basically
166 168 I kind of want to quickly talk on the I kind of want to quickly talk on the
168 172 Java just kind of give you guys a little bit better understanding of what's going
172 177 on public just think of that meaning that it's accessible by other classes or
177 181 other yeah for the most part other classes if it's private for the most
181 186 part won't be being able to be accessed by those other classes and again we're
186 192 setting up a class again that might be confusing word for new Java programmers
192 198 but basically a class defines certain things I'll get into that explanation
198 202 later as we go just know that this is a class what we're setting up all these
202 207 are classes over here under our package and we're extending the activity class
207 212 so we can use this method called oncreate now anytime you guys see void
212 216 that basically means that it's going to be a method we're using a method so when
216 221 you see void just think of a method for the most part and this method is called
221 227 oncreate and what it takes within its parameters is a bundle so this is just
227 230 like a variable we set up so we could change this bundle to something like
230 239 Travis loves bacon again we're just renaming the variable and then we're
239 244 sending that variable to the superclass for the most part and giving some giving
244 251 it some data so we need to change a variable down here - Travis love bacon I
251 256 guess it's supposed to be Travis loves bacon but it's just Travis love bacon
256 261 that's my middle name and my last name love bacon but uh there we go so
261 264 basically we're sending this bundle into our super
264 268 class you guys don't really need to worry about what super is since again it
268 273 sets it up for you but as you guys get into Java you'll realize what that is
273 277 actually doing it's using the method oncreate I just don't worry about that
277 281 okay now the other thing that we want to do for this activity is set up the
281 286 content view this is how we're going to let this activity have the background of
286 291 our layout that we just set up called splash so to do that we use the method
291 298 called set content view and within the parameters we're going to resource or
298 308 reference that splash layout by going r dot layout dot splash and then we just
308 313 need our semicolon and we're good to go basically our activity will load up that
313 320 new splash and I'll show you guys how we can basically uh well just watch the
320 323 next tutorial where we're going to get into the Android manifest again thanks
323 326 guys for watching hope you have a good one hope that someone made sense and
